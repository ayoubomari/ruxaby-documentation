## Choosing Your Escrow Model

Ruxaby offers two escrow models for different product types:

### Trustful Model
- Platform acts as neutral arbitrator
- Best for standard physical products
- Lower barrier for buyers
- Suitable for easily verifiable goods

### P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Model
- Both parties deposit collateral
- No central arbitrator needed
- Ideal for high-risk items:
  - Digital products and gift cards
  - Tickets and redeemable items
  - Services and currency exchange
  - Social media accounts

When selecting P2P, configure:
- **Your collateral deposit percentage** (seller stake)
- **Buyer's collateral deposit percentage** (buyer stake)
