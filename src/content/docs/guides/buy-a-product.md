## Understanding Escrow Models

Ruxaby uses two distinct escrow systems depending on the product type:

### Trustful Model

For standard products using the Trustful model:
- Pay only the product price
- Platform acts as neutral arbitrator
- Funds held in escrow until delivery confirmation
- Standard dispute resolution process

### P2P Model with Collateral

For high-risk items requiring mutual commitment:

#### Additional Collateral Deposit
- **Product Price**: Standard purchase amount
- **Buyer Collateral**: Additional deposit percentage set by seller
- **Total Payment**: Product price + collateral deposit

#### How P2P Collateral Works
1. You pay product price + your collateral deposit
2. Seller also deposits their collateral amount
3. Both parties now have financial stake in successful transaction
4. Upon successful delivery confirmation:
   - Seller receives product payment
   - Both parties get their collateral deposits returned
5. If disputes arise, collateral remains locked until mutual resolution

#### P2P Product Examples
This model is typically used for:
- **Digital Products**: Software licenses, e-books, templates
- **Redeemables**: Gift cards, vouchers, subscription codes
- **Tickets**: Concert, sports, or event passes
- **Services**: Freelance work, tutoring, consulting
- **Currency Exchange**: Crypto-to-fiat or fiat-to-crypto trades
