Welcome to Ruxaby! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to make your first purchase securely. Whether you're buying a physical product or a digital item, our blockchain-powered escrow system is designed to protect you every step of the way.

## Before You Begin: Your Algorand Wallet

To use Ruxaby, you'll need an Algorand wallet. This is your digital identity and where you'll store your funds (ALGO or USDC). Ruxaby is non-custodial, meaning **we never have access to your private keys or your funds**. You are always in control.

- **Recommended Wallets:** Pera Wallet, Defly, or any other WalletConnect-compatible Algorand wallet.
- **Funding Your Wallet:** You will need ALGO or USDC to purchase items.

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Connecting your wallet is how you sign in to Ruxaby. We use your public wallet address as your identifierâ€”no emails, passwords, or personal data required.

1.  Click the **"Connect Wallet"** button, usually found in the top-right corner of the page.
2.  A QR code or a list of compatible wallets will appear.
3.  Open your wallet app on your mobile device and scan the QR code, or select your browser extension wallet.
4.  Approve the connection request within your wallet.
5.  You may be asked to sign a simple, zero fees transaction to prove you own the wallet. This is for security and does not cost anything.

Once connected, you'll see your wallet address displayed, and you're ready to explore the marketplace!

## Step 2: Browse Listings and Find Your Item

You can explore products on the homepage or use the search and filter options to find exactly what you're looking for. As you browse, pay attention to the **Escrow Model** listed on each product page. This is crucial as it determines how the transaction is handled.

-   **Trustful Model:** The Ruxaby platform acts as a neutral third-party arbitrator in case of disputes. This is similar to traditional e-commerce.
-   **P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Model:** A fully decentralized model that uses mutual collateral from both buyer and seller to ensure honesty. Ideal for high-risk or digital items.

## Step 3: Make a Purchase

The purchasing process differs slightly depending on the escrow model.

### Purchasing a "Trustful" Model Item

This is a straightforward process.

1.  On the product page, click the **"Buy Now"** button.
2.  You will be prompted to provide your shipping information if it's a physical product.
3.  Review the order details (price, shipping, etc.).
4.  You will be redirected to your wallet to approve the transaction. The total amount will be the price of the item plus any shipping costs.
5.  Once you approve, the funds are sent to the secure escrow smart contract.

### Purchasing a "P2P" Model Item

This model includes an extra layer of security: a refundable collateral deposit.

1.  On the product page, click the **"Buy Now"** button.
2.  You will be asked to pay the product price **plus a refundable buyer's collateral**. This collateral is your "skin in the game" and will be returned to you when the transaction is completed successfully.
3.  Review the order details, including the item price and the collateral amount.
4.  Approve the transaction in your wallet. The total amount (`Price + Collateral`) is sent to the escrow smart contract.
5.  The seller will then be notified and prompted to deposit their own collateral, ensuring both parties are financially committed to a fair transaction.

## Step 4: After Your Purchase

Once your payment is secured in escrow, the seller takes over.

-   The order status will change from **"Pending"** to **"Processing"** once the seller ships the item and submits tracking information (for physical goods) or sends the digital item.
-   You can track your order's progress from your user dashboard.

## Step 5: Confirm Delivery and Complete the Order

When you receive your item and are satisfied with it, the final step is to confirm delivery. This releases the payment from escrow to the seller.

1.  Go to your **"My Orders"** page.
2.  Find the relevant order and click **"Confirm Delivery"**.
3.  Approve the final transaction in your wallet (this is a simple network action and costs a fraction of a cent in ALGO).

**What happens next?**
-   **For Trustful Orders:** The funds are released to the seller.
-   **For P2P Orders:** The funds are released to the seller, and **both your collateral and the seller's collateral are immediately returned to your respective wallets.**

> **Note:** If you don't take any action after a set period (calculated based on the seller's estimated delivery time), the system will automatically confirm the delivery to ensure sellers are paid in a timely manner.

## Step 6: Leave a Review

After an order is completed, you can leave a review for the seller. Your feedback helps build a trustworthy and transparent community.

On the blockchain, reviews are verifiable. Other buyers can see the transaction history associated with a review, making it incredibly difficult to fake feedback. Your honest review adds real value to the Ruxaby ecosystem!

## What If Something Goes Wrong? Reporting an Issue

If you encounter a problem with your order (e.g., the item doesn't arrive, is not as described, or a digital code is invalid), you can **report the order**.

1.  Go to your **"My Orders"** page.
2.  Click the **"Report Order"** button on the relevant transaction.

-   **In a Trustful Model:** Ruxaby moderators will be notified. They will review the evidence provided by both you and the seller to reach a fair resolution.
-   **In a P2P Model:** Reporting the order freezes all funds in the smart contract, including the seller's payment **and both parties' collateral**. The funds cannot be moved until you and the seller mutually agree on a resolution. This powerful incentive ensures both parties are motivated to resolve the issue honestly.
