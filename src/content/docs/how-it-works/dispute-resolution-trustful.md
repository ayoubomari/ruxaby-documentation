## Valid Evidence Guidelines

**Non-Delivery Issues**:
- Screenshots of tracking showing "delivered" status

**Delivery Confirmation**:
- Carrier delivery confirmation

- Proof of address verification

## Moderator Review Process

### Initial Assessment (24-48 hours)

**Evidence Collection**:
- Moderators review all submitted evidence from both parties
- Request additional documentation if needed
- Verify tracking information independently
- Cross-reference with platform policies

**Preliminary Review**:
- Check for obvious fraud indicators
- Assess evidence quality and completeness
- Identify key points of dispute
- Determine if additional investigation is needed

### Detailed Investigation (2-5 business days)

**Evidence Analysis**:
- Photo/video forensics for tampering signs
- Independent tracking verification with carriers
- Platform history review for both parties
- Communication pattern analysis
- Comparison with similar resolved cases

**Third-Party Verification**:
- Contact shipping carriers when necessary
- Verify product specifications with manufacturers
- Cross-check delivery addresses and recipient information
- Consult external databases for product authenticity

### Decision Framework

**Primary Considerations**:
1. **Evidence Quality**: Clear, unambiguous proof takes precedence
2. **Timeline Consistency**: Actions and claims must align chronologically  
3. **Platform History**: User reputation and past behavior patterns
4. **Policy Compliance**: Adherence to platform terms and listing accuracy
5. **Communication Record**: Good faith efforts to resolve directly

**Decision Matrix**:
- **Strong evidence from one party**: Clear resolution in their favor
- **Conflicting evidence**: Deeper investigation or split resolution
- **Insufficient evidence**: Status quo maintained or shared responsibility
- **Policy violations**: Resolution based on platform rules
