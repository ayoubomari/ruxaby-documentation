# Terms & Conditions ("Terms of Service")

Last updated: 06 Aug 2025

Welcome to Ruxaby ("Ruxaby," "we," "our," or "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Ruxaby website, marketplace, smart-contract escrow services, and any related content (collectively, the "Platform"). By accessing or using the Platform you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

## 1. Eligibility

- You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a legally binding contract to use the Platform.
- You represent that you are not barred from using the Platform under any applicable laws.

## 2. Our Dual-Model Escrow Marketplace

### Trustful Model

- Buyers deposit funds into an Algorand smart-contract escrow.
- The seller ships the goods or delivers the digital item as described.
- If either party opens a dispute within the escrow window, Ruxaby reviews the evidence submitted by both sides and makes a final release decision.

### P2P Model

- Funds flow directly between buyer and seller via a smart contract with no dispute resolution by Ruxaby.
- **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** You waive any and all claims against Ruxaby arising out of P2P transactions.

## 3. Prohibited Listings

You may not list, buy, sell, or otherwise transact in:

- Adult or sexually explicit material
- Firearms, ammunition, explosives, or weapons
- Counterfeit goods or intellectual-property infringing items
- Regulated pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, or drug paraphernalia
- Gambling services or any product whose sale is illegal under U.S. federal or state law

Ruxaby may remove any listing at its sole discretion.

## 4. Fees

- **Listing Fee:** a flat fee (posted in the UI) is paid in ALGO or USDCa when creating a listing.
- **Commission:** a percentage of the final order amount is deducted automatically from escrow on release.
- **Network Fees:** users pay all Algorand transaction fees ("gas").

Fees are non-refundable except as expressly stated in these Terms.

## 5. User Responsibilities

- Provide accurate listing descriptions and honor all commitments.
- Ship goods promptly and with adequate insurance (Trustful Model).
- Keep your wallet credentials secure; transactions are irreversible.
- Comply with all export-control, tax, and other applicable laws.

## 6. Intellectual Property

Ruxaby and all related marks, logos, and code are our property. You receive a limited, non-exclusive license to access and use the Platform. You grant Ruxaby a worldwide, royalty-free license to host and display any content you upload for the purpose of operating the Platform.

## 7. Disclaimers

- The Platform is provided "as is" and "as available." We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
- Blockchain transactions are irreversible and inherently risky. You assume all risks related to cryptographic tokens, price volatility, and smart-contract vulnerabilities.
- Ruxaby is not a bank, broker, or custodian and does not provide investment advice.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Ruxaby and its officers, directors, employees, and affiliates will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill arising from or in connection with the Platform, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability will not exceed the greater of (a) $100 USD or (b) the total fees you paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Ruxaby from any claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to (i) your use of the Platform, (ii) your violation of these Terms, or (iii) your infringement of any rights of a third party.

## 10. Governing Law & Venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and, where not pre-empted, the laws of any state or territory having jurisdiction. Any dispute that cannot be resolved informally shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction within the United States. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

## 11. Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms at any time by posting the revised version on the Platform and updating the "Last updated" date. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
