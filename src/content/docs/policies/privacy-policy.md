# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 06 Aug 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Ruxaby ("Ruxaby," "we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you visit or use our Platform.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Information you provide voluntarily (all optional)
- Full name
- Email address
- Telephone number

### Information collected automatically
- IP address, browser type, device identifiers, and basic server logs
- Transaction metadata inherent to Algorand public blockchain activity (wallet addresses are visible on-chain but are not stored in our internal databases)

We do not use cookies, analytics scripts, or third-party tracking pixels.

## 2. How We Use Information

- To create and manage user accounts (if you choose to provide details)
- To process blockchain escrow transactions and deliver Platform functionality
- To detect, prevent, and address fraud or security issues
- To communicate with you regarding disputes, support requests, or policy updates
- To comply with legal obligations

## 3. Legal Bases (if GDPR applies)

When EU / EEA or UK users interact with the Platform, our legal bases are:
- Contract necessity (providing the Marketplace)
- Legitimate interests (security, anti-fraud)
- Your consent (for any optional data you supply)

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell or rent your personal information. We share data only:
- With service providers who host our servers and must process data solely under our instructions (bound by confidentiality)
- When required by law, subpoena, or court order
- To protect the rights, property, or safety of Ruxaby, our users, or the public

## 5. Data Retention

We retain optional account information until you delete it or close your account. Server logs are retained for up to 30 days for security auditing, then aggregated or deleted. Blockchain data is immutable and cannot be deleted from the public ledger.

## 6. Your Rights

Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to:
- Access or correct your personal data
- Request deletion of optional data stored by us
- Object to or restrict certain processing
- Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (EEA/UK residents)

Email contact@ruxaby.com to exercise any of these rights.

## 7. Security

We employ reasonable administrative and technical safeguards, including encryption in transit (HTTPS) and access controls. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8. Children's Privacy

The Platform is intended for adults 18 years and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a minor has provided us data, contact us and we will delete it.

## 9. International Transfers

Your information may be processed on servers located in the United States. By using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information in the U.S. and other countries where we or our service providers operate.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Material changes will be posted on this page with a new "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Platform after any change constitutes acceptance.
